Comparer inspired by the Kavanaugh - Ford Senate Testimony Bayes' Rule Calculator


Both 'classic' renewables (Solar and Wind) and the often disregarded renewable newclear energy have their own pro's and cons. In this comparere project I would like to visualise and interactivate these pro's and cons to make the complex matters more graspable for laymen.

The hope is that that less well known requirements, dangers, costs, can become more clear while attempting to respect pluralistic viewpoints on clean energy generation.

Below is a table with a rough overview of requirements as a brainstorm to get started. Maybe to convert into a Baysian calculator like for the [Kavanaugh case here](http://www.saund.org/kavanaugh-bayes/kavanaugh-ford-bayes-calculator.html)


| Requirement                                 | Wind | Solar | Nuclear |
|-------------|------|-------|---------|
| C02 production (during the full lifecycle) |  Blades, mining, construction, concrete  |  mining, production     |  mining, construction,        |
| Capital Costs involved.                    |   low   |  low     |    high     |
| Operational Costs involved.|   high   |  low    |    high     |
| Material requirements|  Neodimium     |    Silicium, cobalt   |   Uranium      |
| Production requirements|      |       |         |
| Placement requirements|   windy areas, NIMBY    |        |   Near water for cooling      |
| Recycling requirements|      |      |    Included in capital setup costs     |
| Accompanying energy storage requirements|   required   |   required    |   not required      |
| Dangers involved (for humans, wildlife, environment, ...)|  dangerous servicing, bad for wildlife    |   /    |   Dangerous in case of disaster      |
| Centeralised vs distributed|  distributed    |   distributed    |    centeralised |
| Research horizon|  ?    |    50% efficiency   |  promising in 10y (SMR, thorium, ...)       |
